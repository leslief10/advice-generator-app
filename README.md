## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I recently took a class to learn more about APIs and how to consume them, so I think this was the perfect challenge to practice what I learned. I decided to do it with vanilla JS and without any libraries, so I could concentrate only on the consumption of the API. I'm really excited about how this project turned out in general :).

### Continued development

I will keep practicing API consumption and I will like to try and do this project again with React.
